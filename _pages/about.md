I am a Research Associate in the <a href="https://www.swacil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swarm & Computational Intelligence Lab (SwaCIL)</a> within the Department of Computer Science at Durham University, working under the supervision of Professor Farshad Arvin. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Manchester in 2024, where I collaborated with Professor Alexander Lanzon on control design for multi-agent systems. My doctoral research focused on formation control, formation-containment control, and negative imaginary systems theory, with experimental validation on UAV platforms. Prior to that, I earned an MSc with Distinction in Advanced Control and Systems Engineering from the University of Manchester in 2019, and a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan in 2017.
